# about-me
This project uses HTML, CSS and JS to create an interactive website that asks for input from the user and makes a guessing game out of it.
The website will guess answers for five yes/no questions which are presented to the user. Using JS, the interactive questions are prompted to the user. After the five yes/no questions, the user will be asked to guess the states that the developer has already been to prior to Seattle. The user will be then provided with the result of the guessing game.
Using CSS, we will design the website so that it looks presentable to the user. We will be using borders, margins, paddle, font style, color, background and other features to improve on the layout of the website.

Partner programming with Peter Tynan
